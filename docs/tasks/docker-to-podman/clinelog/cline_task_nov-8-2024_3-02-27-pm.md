<thinking>
To perform the initial system assessment, I need to:
1. First read the task description and system interaction guide to understand the scope
2. Then analyze the current system configuration files
3. Document my findings in a new assessment document

Let me start by reading the task description and system interaction guide.

# Task

Guide me through my migration of Docker to Podman.

Its current state is a result of my attempts to get Traefik running on the WSL2 Ubuntu machine on Wet-Ham. After much frustration, I decided it might be easier to just run the stack on the Windows machine (because of the privileged ports it needs) and let the reverse proxy point to all the services running on the WSL2 machine. 

## Device Inventory

- Wet-Ham (Windows)
- Tonnys-Butt (Ubuntu WSL2 on Wet-Ham)
- Bologna-Tramp (podman-machine on Wet-Ham Windows)
- Emma (Synology NAS)
- Netgear Nighthawk (WiFi 6 Router)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tonnys-Butt (Wet-Ham's WSL2 Ubuntu) is running podman where most containers will be deployed
- Bologna-Tramp (podman-machine on Wet-Ham Windows) is running podman desktop where Traefik will be deployed and where the delorenzo.family and the delo.sh domains will be routed
- Traefik is deployed and running on Bologna-Tramp
- Both the delorenzo.family and delo.sh domains are correctly configured for namecheap dnschallenge
- From Wet-Ham (Windows), I can curl `hai.delo.sh` and a hello-world container at that address that is deployed on Tonnys-Butt (WSL2 on Wet-Ham) should respond with a 200 status code and a message of "Hello World"
- From Wet-Ham (Windows), I can curl the traefik dashboard at `traefik.delorenzo.family` and see the dashboard

How to access and interact with the various machines and containers.

## The Traefik Stack's Current State

- It is a git repository named `DeLoProxy`
- It is cloned and located in the windows filesystem of Wet-Ham at     `C:\Users\jarad\code\DeLoProxy`
- It currently consists of a single Traefik container, but I call the repo "DeLoProxy" because I plan on adding more services to it in the future.
- The deploy location is on `bologna-tramp` which is a podman machine on Wet-Ham Windows.

## Wet-Ham:Local Host Machine

- OS: Windows 11 with WSL2 Ubuntu
- Working Directory: This project (and you!) is mounted in the windows filesystem of Wet-Ham
- Primary Shell: PowerShell
- Default PowerShell Prompt: `PS C:\Users\jarad\code\DeLoProxy>`
- Optional Shell: Windows Terminal

## Tonnys-Butt:WSL2 Ubuntu

- OS: Ubuntu WSL2 on Windows 11

<content># Initial System Assessment

## Current System Architecture

### Infrastructure Overview
- **Wet-Ham** (Windows 11)
  - Primary host machine
  - Running Windows Terminal and PowerShell
  - Hosts WSL2 Ubuntu instance
  - Project location: `C:\Users\jarad\code\DeLoProxy`

- **Tonnys-Butt** (WSL2 Ubuntu on Wet-Ham)
  - Target for main container deployments
  - Podman root directory: `/home/delorenj/podman`
  - Running Zsh shell

- **Bologna-Tramp** (Podman machine on Wet-Ham Windows)
  - Designated for Traefik deployment
  - Will handle routing for delorenzo.family and delo.sh domains

- **Emma** (Synology NAS)
  - Network attached storage system
  - Current role in architecture to be determined

- **Netgear Nighthawk** (WiFi 6 Router)
  - Network infrastructure

### Current Traefik Configuration Analysis

#### Container Configuration
- Using Traefik v2.10
- Running with essential security configurations:
  - No new privileges
  - NET_BIND_SERVICE capability
- Port mappings:
  - 8080:80 (HTTP)
  - 8443:443 (HTTPS)
  - 9000:8080 (Dashboard)

#### Key Features
1. **SSL/TLS**
   - Configured for two separate certificate resolvers:
     - delorenzo.family domain
     - delo.sh domain
   - Using Namecheap DNS challenge for certificate validation
   - TLS minimum version set to 1.2

2. **Security**
   - Basic authentication enabled for dashboard
   - Secure headers middleware configured with:
     - SSL redirect
     - HSTS with preload
     - Subdomains included in HSTS
   - API security enabled (insecure mode disabled)

3. **Provider Configuration**
   - Docker provider enabled
   - File provider with dynamic configuration
   - Containers not exposed by default (explicit opt-in required)

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Dashboard enabled at traefik.delorenzo.family
   - Access logs enabled
   - Log level set to INFO

## Migration Challenges & Considerations

1. **Socket Access**
   - Current setup uses Docker socket
   - Need to transition to Podman socket
   - Path adjustment required: `/run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock`

2. **Network Architecture**
   - Complex routing between Windows host and WSL2
   - Need to ensure proper communication between:
     - Bologna-Tramp (Traefik) â†’ Tonnys-Butt (Services)
     - External traffic â†’ Bologna-Tramp â†’ Tonnys-Butt

3. **Volume Mounts**
   - Current Docker volume mounts need verification for Podman compatibility
   - SELinux context (`:Z`) already in place, which is good for Podman

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Need to ensure proper transfer of:
     - NAMECHEAP_API_USER
     - NAMECHEAP_API_KEY
     - TRAEFIK_AUTH

## Next Steps

1. **Podman Setup**
   - Verify Podman installation on both Tonnys-Butt and Bologna-Tramp
   - Configure Podman socket accessibility

2. **Container Migration**
   - Convert docker-compose.yml to Podman compatible format
   - Test Traefik container on Bologna-Tramp
   - Verify socket connectivity

3. **Network Configuration**
   - Set up routing between Bologna-Tramp and Tonnys-Butt
   - Configure port forwarding as needed
   - Verify DNS resolution

4. **Testing Plan**
   - Verify SSL certificate generation
   - Test dashboard accessibility
   - Validate routing between systems
   - Deploy test container for hai.delo.sh endpoint

# Task

Guide me through my migration of Docker to Podman.

Its current state is a result of my attempts to get Traefik running on the WSL2 Ubuntu machine on Wet-Ham. After much frustration, I decided it might be easier to just run the stack on the Windows machine (because of the privileged ports it needs) and let the reverse proxy point to all the services running on the WSL2 machine. 

## Device Inventory

- Wet-Ham (Windows)
- Tonnys-Butt (Ubuntu WSL2 on Wet-Ham)
- Bologna-Tramp (podman-machine on Wet-Ham Windows)
- Emma (Synology NAS)
- Netgear Nighthawk (WiFi 6 Router)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tonnys-Butt (Wet-Ham's WSL2 Ubuntu) is running podman where most containers will be deployed
- Bologna-Tramp (podman-machine on Wet-Ham Windows) is running podman desktop where Traefik will be deployed and where the delorenzo.family and the delo.sh domains will be routed
- Traefik is deployed and running on Bologna-Tramp
- Both the delorenzo.family and delo.sh domains are correctly configured for namecheap dnschallenge
- From Wet-Ham (Windows), I can curl `hai.delo.sh` and a hello-world container at that address that is deployed on Tonnys-Butt (WSL2 on Wet-Ham) should respond with a 200 status code and a message of "Hello World"
- From Wet-Ham (Windows), I can curl the traefik dashboard at `traefik.delorenzo.family` and see the dashboard

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Based on the feedback, I understand that:
1. All documentation should be in the 'docs/tasks/docker-to-podman/' directory
2. We need to proceed with Migration Planning
3. The initial system assessment is already in place

Let me create a migration plan document that outlines the detailed steps needed to achieve the acceptance criteria.

<content># Migration Plan: Docker to Podman

This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating from Docker to Podman, based on the initial system assessment and acceptance criteria.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

### 1.1 Bologna-Tramp (Windows Host) Setup
- [ ] Verify Podman Desktop installation
- [ ] Configure Podman machine settings
  - Memory allocation
