# Task

Guide me through my migration of Docker to Podman.

Its current state is a result of my attempts to get Traefik running on the WSL2 Ubuntu machine on Wet-Ham. After much frustration, I decided it might be easier to just run the stack on the Windows machine (because of the privileged ports it needs) and let the reverse proxy point to all the services running on the WSL2 machine. 

## Device Inventory

- Wet-Ham (Windows)
- Tonnys-Butt (Ubuntu WSL2 on Wet-Ham)
- Bologna-Tramp (podman-machine on Wet-Ham Windows)
- Emma (Synology NAS)
- Netgear Nighthawk (WiFi 6 Router)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tonnys-Butt (Wet-Ham's WSL2 Ubuntu) is running podman where most containers will be deployed
- Bologna-Tramp (podman-machine on Wet-Ham Windows) is running podman desktop where Traefik will be deployed and where the delorenzo.family and the delo.sh domains will be routed
- Traefik is deployed and running on Bologna-Tramp
- Both the delorenzo.family and delo.sh domains are correctly configured for namecheap dnschallenge
- From Wet-Ham (Windows), I can curl `hai.delo.sh` and a hello-world container at that address that is deployed on Tonnys-Butt (WSL2 on Wet-Ham) should respond with a 200 status code and a message of "Hello World"
- From Wet-Ham (Windows), I can curl the traefik dashboard at `traefik.delorenzo.family` and see the dashboard
